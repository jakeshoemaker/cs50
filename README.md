# CS50 Problem sets
This is where all the problems from CS50 will go.

CS50 is a free course offered by Harvard through EdX. Throughout the course most of the problem sets will be programmed in C, but the later weeks we dive into Python and SQL. Final Project is to incorporate all the things learned in the course.
